    title: 'Beginner · Never used crypto',
    intel: 'Start from zero. Kaspa is public digital cash. You hold keys. Miners spend energy so rewriting history is expensive. That is proof of work. Help is for questions. Explore is to look at real blocks.',
    body: `<h2>Start here</h2>
      <p>You do not need a course. You need a few words, one picture of a payment, and a place to try the rules without risking real money. That is this door, then the playground.</p>
      <h2>What this is</h2>
      <p>Ordinary money is an account at a company. They can freeze it, reverse it, or go down. Crypto, in the original sense, is a public ledger that anyone can check. You hold keys. You sign a payment. Miners spend electricity to propose the next records. Other computers check the work. Nobody in the middle has to approve you.</p>
      <p>That energy is not decoration. It is the cost of lying about history. If rewriting the ledger were cheap, a thief could spend the same coins twice. Proof of work makes that expensive. Proof of stake replaced that cost with a vote of who already holds the coin. Kaspa did not take that turn. It is still proof of work.</p>
      <h2>Words you will see</h2>
      <p>Read these once. Come back if a later sentence uses them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keys.</strong> Secret numbers that prove a payment is yours. If you lose them, the coins are gone. If you share a recovery phrase, you have given the coins away.</li>
        <li><strong>Wallet.</strong> Software that holds keys and builds payments. It is not a bank account. An exchange account is a claim on a company, not keys you hold. A phone or extension wallet still trusts that device and the RPC it asks. Your own node is the check. You can skip the node on day one. Know that you skipped it.</li>
        <li><strong>Ledger.</strong> The public list of coins and who can spend them. Anyone can download it. Nobody asks permission to read it.</li>
        <li><strong>Miner.</strong> A machine that spends electricity to propose the next records. Mining is not a salary from Kaspa. It is a race to find valid work.</li>
        <li><strong>Node.</strong> A computer that stores the ledger and checks the rules. You can run one. You do not have to. Someone still has to.</li>
        <li><strong>Block.</strong> A batch of payments plus proof of work. Kaspa can have more than one honest block at the same time. That bunch of blocks is a blockDAG, not a single chain.</li>
        <li><strong>Fee.</strong> A small amount paid to get into a block. It is not a bank wire fee. If the network is quiet, it can be tiny. If it is busy, it rises.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>A payment in four beats</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>You send.</strong> Your wallet signs. The payment is now a message on the network. Sending is not settling.</li>
        <li><strong>It is included.</strong> A miner puts it in a block. Inclusion is not the same as “done.”</li>
        <li><strong>It is accepted.</strong> The network’s agreed history now treats that payment as the spend. The old coins cannot be spent again.</li>
        <li><strong>The recipient waits as they choose.</strong> A coffee and a house sale do not need the same wait. Kaspa does not pick that policy for them.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The playground slows this down so you can press the stages. Use it after this page, not instead of reading.</p>
      <h2>There is no undo</h2>
      <p>Wrong <code>kaspa:</code> string, wrong amount, or <code>kaspatest:</code> sent as if it were mainnet: nobody here, not miners, not Discord, can reverse it. The recipient can send it back. That is a new payment. Practice on Testnet-10 first.</p>
      <h2>Who can see this</h2>
      <p>Anyone can look up a <code>kaspa:</code> address on kaspa.stream and see every payment that address ever made. That is how you check a payment. It is also how someone who knows your address watches you. Reusing one address forever makes that easy. Kaspa is not Monero.</p>
      <h2>Where Kaspa sits</h2>
      <p>Bitcoin is the same idea: miners, keys, no premine as a fair-launch story. Bitcoin is a chain. When two honest miners find a block at the same time, one block is thrown away. Kaspa is a blockDAG. Honest parallel blocks stay. GHOSTDAG puts them in order. About ten blocks per second on mainnet today. That is a target rate, not a promise that your coffee is irreversible in a tenth of a second.</p>
      <p>Most later coins sold speed by changing the security story: staking, a small set of validators, or a company sequencer. Kaspa’s bet is the opposite. Keep Bitcoin’s root. Make the ledger fast enough that payments and, later, spending rules can live on it without a second chain.</p>
      <h2>What still costs you</h2>
      <p>If you lose the keys, the coins are gone. If mining concentrates, a few operators matter more than the diagram suggests. Nodes still have to hear every block. Ten blocks per second is work for the network, not free throughput. Inclusion in a block is not the same as acceptance in the agreed history.</p>
      <h2>How to start without getting hurt</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not paste a recovery phrase into a website, a chat, or this site. Nobody here can recover a seed. No Discord helper needs one. Bitcoin and Monero already settled that.</li>
        <li>Read the whole address before you send. Not the first and last four characters. Prefer a saved address over copying from recent history. After a QR, read the destination in the wallet, not on the poster.</li>
        <li>Learn on Testnet-10 first. tKAS is faucet money. It is not mainnet KAS.</li>
        <li>An explorer is a window. A node checks the rules. kaspa.stream is not rusty-kaspa.</li>
        <li>Watch the Graph Inspector on this page for the live picture. If it stops, treat it as paused, not as a dead network. A candle chart is not that picture.</li>
        <li>Price talk is not a source. If someone leads with a target, close the tab and come back here.</li>
        <li>When you have a question, say what you did, which network, and the error text. Ask in Help, not in a random reply.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Door 2 is next if you already know Bitcoin or Ethereum and only need Kaspa placed. If you are still new, stay here, then Help and Explore.</p>

    title: 'Intermediate · Knows crypto, not Kaspa',
    intel: 'Intermediate. Kaspa is still proof of work. Parallel honest blocks are kept and ordered. Speed is not a new security story. Compare it to the chain you already know, then check what is actually live.',
    body: `<h2>The one-sentence difference</h2>
      <p>Bitcoin selects a chain and orphans the rest. Kaspa represents concurrent proof-of-work in a DAG and orders it with GHOSTDAG. The double-spend check still happens after ordering. A DAG is not a free pass to spend twice.</p>
      <p>If you already think in UTXOs, fees, and confirmation policy, you can skip Door 1. Stay here until you can place Kaspa without borrowing Ethereum’s words.</p>
      <h2>Against the rest of the map</h2>
      <p><strong>Bitcoin.</strong> Same PoW cash lineage, UTXO ledger, no premine. Kaspa’s block interval is much shorter. That does not copy Bitcoin’s settlement culture. Recipients still pick a policy. Node bandwidth and validation cost rise with the extra blocks. If a Bitcoiner asks “is it final?”, the honest answer is: inclusion, acceptance, and the recipient’s wait are three different things. Same as Bitcoin, faster blocks.</p>
      <p><strong>Ethereum.</strong> Ethereum moved to proof of stake and an account virtual machine. Kaspa stayed with miners and UTXOs. Toccata added spending rules (covenants), covenant IDs, a ZK precompile, and sequencing lanes. That is not the EVM. You do not deploy a Solidity app onto Kaspa L1 today and get Ethereum’s tooling. “Smart contracts on Kaspa” is a sentence that needs a label: covenants are live protocol; application compilers are not all stable.</p>
      <p><strong>High-throughput PoS and L2s.</strong> Fast inclusion is often a sequencer or a validator set. Kaspa’s speed is many proof-of-work blocks. Honest work that arrives late is kept, not discarded. 100 BPS is a research target, not a spec. Crescendo’s 10 BPS is live. If you came from Solana, do not map TPS slogans onto block rate. Nodes still receive, validate, and store every block.</p>
      <h2>UTXO, not an account VM</h2>
      <p>Coins live as unspent outputs. A payment consumes outputs and creates new ones. Change is an output back to you. A covenant is a spending rule attached to an output: wait, limit, name the recipient, require a proof. That is closer to Bitcoin Script than to an EVM contract with storage.</p>
      <p>Shared execution among many users (a lending pool, an AMM with one global book) is a different problem. Covenants do not by themselves give you that. vProgs are the research name for based programs with validity proofs. They are not a product testnet you can treat as live.</p>
      <h2>Live versus later</h2>
      <p>Use these labels. Mix them and you are pitching.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Live.</strong> GHOSTDAG. 10 BPS (Crescendo). Toccata protocol rules on mainnet. rusty-kaspa v2.0.1 is the maintenance tag checked here.</li>
        <li><strong>v1.0.0.</strong> SilverScript compiler tagged 9 Sep 2026. Application readiness is separate. MIX Town still pins v1-rc1 until retargeted.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototype.</strong> Argent. Examples exist. The README says it is not release-ready.</li>
        <li><strong>Isolated beta.</strong> Parker’s Kaspa Studio, branch <code>studio-beta</code>, 9 Sep 2026. Local workbench. Not this public MIX site. Does not broadcast. V5 and V6 stay withdrawn.</li>
        <li><strong>Research.</strong> vProgs. Repository existence is not production.</li>
        <li><strong>Proposed.</strong> DAGKnight. The rusty <code>dagknight</code> branch is not merged. No mainnet activation is documented in the checked KIP or node releases.</li>
        <li><strong>Local model.</strong> Dated 8 September 2026. Inherited budget, atomic offer completion, competing execution, a correction bounty, and a permission arena. You can break them. They do not sign or submit.</li>
        <li><strong>Testnet lab.</strong> Existing covenant primitives on Testnet-10. This site’s Town is that lab. One browser holds every key. That is not three independent people.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdrawn.</strong> Parker’s hosted V5 and V6, 8 September 2026. Town at /covenants stays. MIX does not ship those versions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A merged Active KIP is law. A tweet, a Discord rumor, and a forum thread are not. Toccata is consensus. silverc is a compiler. People still mix those two in chat.</p>
      <h2>Practices that do not change with the chain</h2>
      <p>Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero already settled these. Kaspa does not get a waiver.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keys you hold versus a balance at a company.</li>
        <li>Never paste a recovery phrase. No vendor, no Discord helper, no website.</li>
        <li>An explorer is a window. A node is the check.</li>
        <li>Compiler success, a local VM, and network acceptance are three facts. Parker’s Studio beta says the same. MIX does not ship that workbench.</li>
        <li>A Kasware or Kastle app still trusts whoever answers RPC unless it talks to your kaspad.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Do not mix layers</h2>
      <p>Keys on L1 are coins the network will spend. An exchange balance is a company claim. Wrap lab is a Testnet-10 receipt, not L1 cash. PegLab is a toy peg that is meant to break. Town tKAS is faucet money in one browser. Lightning channels and Cashu mints are the same kind of split: a layer or an operator is not the base coin. Solana Devnet is not mainnet. Testnet-10 is not cheaper mainnet KAS.</p>
      <h2>What speed does not buy</h2>
      <p>It does not remove miner concentration. It does not make every wallet support covenants. It does not make a repository into a product. It does not make a price chart into evidence. The skeptical list is the same as for any PoW coin, plus the extra node cost of a fast DAG.</p>
      <p>Door 3 is the dated machine: KIPs, builder network, node. If you only wanted the map, open status and the playground next.</p>

      <p>These labs are not mainnet products.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local models.</strong> A child budget cannot expand its parent. Atomic completion cannot take custody. Two providers cannot charge the same output twice. A bounty pays a valid correction. A permission arena is for attacks you expect to fail. Break them here. They do not touch the chain.</li>
        <li><strong>Testnet contract lab.</strong> Allowance, bundle, group pledge, schedule, delayed vault. Real Testnet-10 spends of existing primitives. Town is that lab on this site. All three keys live in this browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Kaspa Studio.</strong> Isolated local beta on Parker’s <code>studio-beta</code> branch, 9 Sep 2026. Synthetic unfunded UTXOs. Compiler success, VM check, and network acceptance are separate. Not shipped on MIX. Does not broadcast.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>The digital-cash story is still the honest one: PoW, UTXO, fair launch. The DAG is how Kaspa tries to keep that story at a payment-like interval. That is a different shape from “EVM L2 on a PoS L1.” It is also earlier. Wallets, indexers, and compilers are catching up. Discord still spends most of its volume on wallet UX, fees, and “is SilverScript the hardfork?” No. Toccata is consensus. silverc is a compiler.</p>
      <h2>Builder path that does not lie</h2>
      <p>Testnet-10 is the builder network. Do not use testnet-12. Addresses start with <code>kaspatest:</code>. Official start: kaspa.org/build. This site’s Node tab is the Windows/Linux/mac path that actually ran: dedicated folder, rusty-kaspa v2.0.1, CPU miner on 16210, explorer tn10.kaspa.stream. GPU on public TN10 is physics, not etiquette.</p>
      <p>If you are mining tKAS, bring the address to the playground. This site does not drip faucet coins at you. Faucet: faucet-tn10.kaspanet.io. PegLab if someone says they need a stable for a dapp. It is a toy that will depeg. Not a business.</p>
      <h2>Costs you already know and should not skip</h2>
      <p>Node cost scales with block rate. Mining can still pool. A live opcode is not an audited app. A public node is not a miner and is not a wallet. Do not expose open RPC that can sign. Check kaspa.stream/nodes if you meant to be a public peer.</p>
      <p>Door 4 is for people who will repeat sentences in public. If you are building, stay on Node, Build, and status until a claim has a KIP or a release tag.</p>

      <p>Bitcoiners will ask about settlement and node cost. Answer: recipients pick a policy; nodes still hear every block; faster interval is not Bitcoin’s culture copied. Ethereum people will look for a VM and a token standard. Answer: covenants on UTXOs, not the EVM; KCC-0020 is Draft. Solana people will look for throughput and then skip the security model. Answer: many PoW blocks, not a leader schedule; capacity is not demand.</p>

        <li><strong>Research.</strong> A paper, a branch, a prototype. Not a product.</li>
        <li><strong>Wrong.</strong> Contradicted by the node, the KIP status, or the dated snapshot. Say so.</li>
        <li><strong>Local model.</strong> You can break it here. It does not prove a mainnet product.</li>
        <li><strong>Testnet lab.</strong> Real tKAS, unaudited, one browser holding every key. Not mainnet, not independent counterparties.</li>

      <p>A consensus rule can be live while every product on top is a prototype. A GitHub org is not production. Testnet-10 is not mainnet. “Core” is not a legal title. Yonatan’s rough core list on X is a starting map, not a badge.</p>
      <h2>How to check a sentence before you post it</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Does a KIP, a rusty-kaspa release, or docs.kaspa.org say it?</li>
        <li>Is the status Active, Draft, Proposed, or a README warning?</li>
        <li>Did you date the claim? Supply, DAA, and subsidy move.</li>
        <li>Are you mixing protocol (Toccata) with a compiler (SilverScript) or a research repo (vProgs)?</li>
        <li>Would the sentence still be true if the KAS price were zero?</li>
        <li>Are you calling a local model a live app, or a Testnet-10 lab a mainnet product?</li>
        <li>Did you verify on a node or an explorer yourself, or only on a screenshot?</li>
        <li>Would the sentence still be true on Bitcoin or Ethereum without renaming the brand?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If step 5 fails, you were talking about a market, not the machine. Take it to Moonboy and leave it there.</p>
      <h2>What an expert still owes</h2>
      <p>Node cost at 10 BPS. Mining pools. Wallet gaps on covenants. Indexer honesty. Settlement policy chosen by the recipient, not by a slogan. Independent review before mainnet funds in a new spending rule. None of that is solved by being early, loud, or sure.</p>
      <p>Community rule on this site: be mature. No price predictions. Build. Share ideas. Keep a positive critical mindset. If you will teach, send people to Door 1 through Door 3 in order, then here, then sources. The playground exists so you can break a double spend instead of arguing about one.</p>
